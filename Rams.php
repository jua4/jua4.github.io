		<p>Vuvu was our new stud ram for 2014. He was a March lamb with Rambouillet and Corriedale breeding who was purchased from Maybe Tomorrow Farm. He is a finer-fleeced ram with an extremely long body and a very consistent, soft fleece. He placed first in a large Junior Ram Lamb class at the Northeast Youth Sheep Show and ended up being the Reserve Champion ram. He is pictured at four months old.</p>
		<h2>Reference Sires:</h2>
		<p>Flopsy was our stud ram for 2013. At the Northeast Youth Sheep Show, he was the biggest, tallest, longest ram in the Suffolk Intermediate ram class, but was faulted for having too much dark fiber in his fleece. As a yearling he placed first in all his classes and was mentioned in two Supreme Ram drives.</p>
		<p>Hyle: Our stud ram for the 2012 and 2013 lambing seasons was a black and white Rambouillet from Hyline Farm. He was the Supreme Champion Ram at Addison County Field Days in 2012. Most of our brood ewes are out of him.</p>

		<p>J.A. Sheep Farm raises Natural Colored sheep in Whiting, Vermont. We produce breeding and show stock as well as freezer lambs. Our animals tend to have strong Rambouillet bloodlines, but as is typical with natural coloreds, many other breeds are mixed in. The flock started as a Natural Colored flock called "Jarrod's 4-H Project" and at one time also included a flock of registered Navajo-Churros. The Navajo-Churro flock was given to SDG Farm, which raises Soays, Navajo-Churros and various other livestock. The natural colored sheep of J.A. Sheep Farm currently live on SDG farm as well.
